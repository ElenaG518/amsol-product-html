<p><strong>What is Pain Spray?</strong><br /> 
Premiere's Pain Spray is a soothing herbal pain relief spray that works in less than 2 minutes. More than 5 million bottles of this all-natural, clear liquid formula have been used by people of every age, living with all sorts of aches and pains. Apply a light mist to any outside area of the body that hurts and within seconds the relief begins. Safe & non-habit forming.</p>

<p><strong>Who should use Pain Spray?</strong><br /> 
Pain Spray can help anyone in pain, whether it's an occasional sports sprain or ongoing joint pain. It's perfect for people with chronic pain conditions like arthritis, carpal tunnel, tendonitis, pinched nerves, sciatic, restless leg syndrome or fibromyalgia. It also offers great relief for muscle pain, back pain, swollen joints, foot and ankle pain, neck pain and shoulder pain relief. Helps relieve leg cramps, bruising and morning stiffness. Pregnant women can use it on their sore back, hips, legs and feet. And because it provides such powerful, all natural pain relief, it's a favorite among naturopaths, chiropractors, physical therapists and massage therapists.</p>

<p><strong>How often can Pain Spray be applied?</strong><br /> 
Because it's an all herbal pain relief remedy, you can use Pain Spray as often as you like. Some people find that 2 or 3 squirts each morning offer all-day relief. Others like to re-apply periodically throughout the day. Just point the spray-nozzle right at the places that hurt, and mist. The more you apply, the stronger the effect. Never messy, like old-fashioned creams, gels and ointments. And Pain Spray smells as refreshing as a field of wild peppermint. </p>

<p><strong>What are the ingredients in Pain Spray? </strong><br /> 
Every ingredient in this herbal pain relief blend is approved by the FDA. The most powerful ingredient is extra-pure imported menthol. Natural wintergreen, eucalyptus and peppermint oils are added to enhance the therapeutic benefits and to lend a refreshing aroma. Then a variety of herbal moisturizers are blended in, to help protect skin from dryness. All-herbal Pain Spray is never greasy. It won't stain skin or fabrics. </p>

<p><strong>How does Pain Spray work?</strong><br /> 
When nerves, muscles or joints are irritated, they send powerful pain signals to the brain. The body's natural reaction is to tense up. Unfortunately, that tension only increases the perception of pain.  And the body tightens even more. It's a vicious cycle. Pain Spray can stop pain fast because it takes advantage of an important medical fact: the brain can process only one new sensory message at a time. By replacing pain signals with equally intense alternatives (initially a rejuvenating cool sensation followed by deep, soothing warmth) this herbal pain relief spray interrupts the pain-tension-pain cycle.</p>

<p><strong>How long does the pain relief last?</strong><br /> 
Count on hours of relief. And the more you spray, the longer it will last. Typically, Pain Spray soothes discomfort for 1 to 5 hours, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the amount of formula that's applied. You also can enjoy added benefit by taking a hot bath or shower before you spray it on. The warm water will open your pores, allowing the powerful herbal formula to sink deeper down, easing even more of the pain.</p>

<p><strong>Can Pain Spray become addictive?</strong><br /> 
No, Pain Spray is 100% non-habit forming and never causes drowsiness. In fact, the formula is associated with absolutely no harmful side effects. </p>

<p><strong>Does Pain Spray interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br /> 
No, Pain Spray does not interfere with the efficacy of any prescription medication. In fact, it can be a wonderful "companion" to many traditional pain relief treatments and drugs.</p>

<p><strong>Would Pain Spray Roll-On be better for me than the Spray?</strong><br /> 
Pain Spray Roll-On contains all the same ingredients as our Original Pain Spray formula. But a light botanical thickener gets added to the Roll-On, allowing it to stay exactly where it's applied. So the spray bottle is best for covering large, easy-to-reach places that you don't want to actually touch with an applicator. The Roll-On is great for targeting localized pain, or soreness in hard-to-reach places. It's popular with active adults and weekend sports enthusiasts who need occasional relief from mild sports injuries or strained muscles after a tough workout, heavy housework or gardening. It also works well for youngsters because the rollerball bottle is easy for them to use. Dries in 1 minute.</p>
