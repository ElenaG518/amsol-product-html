            La Vie en C Facial Cleanser is a pure, gentle, but effective liquid "soap" that eliminates superficial dirt and environmental contaminants while nourishing the skin with ingredients that make it look and feel healthy. Organic rosehip seed oil and fruit extract, vitamins C, vitamin E, chamomile, and rosemary extract supply powerful antioxidants and nutrients to neutralize free radicals and promote a brighter, calmer, more youthful complexion. Manufactured exclusively in small batches, under the strictest quality-control standards, every bottle contains a handmade blend of natural ingredients.<br /><br />La Vie en C Facial Cleanser has been formulated with "stabilized vitamin C" (as ascorbic acid), the newest breakthrough in modern skincare science. Dermatologists and aestheticians have known for years that vitamin C could diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production, and improve the skin's texture and elasticity. The problem has been an inability to keep vitamin C fresh and active. But La Vie en C has moved beyond this barrier, offering a long-lasting and pure facial soap infused with powerful skin-enhancing ingredients as well as antioxidants and nutrients to protect the skin and keep it looking its best.<br /><br />Women and men of all ages can benefit from La Vie en C Facial Cleanser because it cleans without over-stripping the natural oils that hydrate and protect the skin. Women like the combination of a revolutionary cleanser and anti-aging skin "food". Plus, this Facial Cleanser is ideal for mature skin, so it can be a trusted part of every woman's anti-aging skincare regimen. La Vie en C Facial Cleanser also addresses the unique needs of male skin, and almost instantly calms the redness and discomfort of razor burn. In fact, it makes an ideal shaving lotion because its nourishing ingredients soothe facial tissue as the razor travels along the surface skin. It helps with acne-prone skin. Even ideal for people with eczema, psoriasis and other skin sensitivity issues.<br /><br />For best results, cleanse twice a day. Use La Vie en C Facial Cleanser in the morning to clean away the oil, dirt and bacteria that inevitably accumulate overnight. Use it in the evening to wash away make-up, daily grime and pollutants. You can wash your face with your fingertips, making sure that your hands are clean. Or use a clean washcloth that has been soaked in lukewarm water. Don't over-scrub. Take care to avoid the eye area. Rinse well. Pat skin dry with a soft, clean towel. Follow with you choice of toner, serum and/or moisturizer.
