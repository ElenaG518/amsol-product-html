<p><strong>What is Easy Air Organic Allergy Relief Spray?</strong><br />
This 100% organic spray formula is a laboratory-tested treatment for indoor allergies and asthma symptoms. Unscented and biodegradable, it offers relief by destroying the actual molecules of ALL indoor contaminants. It's like taking a deadly boulder and crumbling it into harmless rubble. Made with all natural ingredients, it is a family-safe alternative to pesticides and other harsh chemical products.</p>

<p><strong>How does Easy Air Organic Allergy Relief Spray work?</strong><br />
Spray a light mist onto mattress, pillows, upholstery, rugs and draperies to instantly destroy the environmental contaminants that provoke indoor allergy and asthma symptoms. These contaminants float through the air and into every home and office. No amount of cleaning can get rid of them. That's one reason for the EPA warning calling American homes the most allergy-provoking places in the country! Used regularly, Easy Air Organic Allergy Relief Spray can offer relief and make your home or office an Allergy-Free Zone for up to 4 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>What are "indoor allergens"?</strong><br />
They're the invisibly small protein particles shed by all living creatures. Dust and dust mites are major culprits. So are "pet residuals" (like fur, dander, saliva, urine and feathers) that often activate cat allergy symptoms and provoke dog allergies. Even our own bodies produce these allergens, in the form of perspiration and dead skin cells which we shed continuously, day and night. All these contaminants can provoke allergy and asthma symptoms. </p>

<p><strong>What are the symptoms of indoor allergies?</strong><br />
The most common indoor allergy symptoms are similar to bad cold symptoms: puffy or red eyes, tearing and burning, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, and upper respiratory congestion. Bad headaches and sinus pressure can also be symptoms. In more extreme cases, symptoms can also include itchy skin and rashes, shortness of breath, extreme exhaustion and even serious joint pain. </p>

<p><strong>What causes asthma & indoor allergies? </strong><br />
Frankly, there are many causes of indoor allergies. Scientists think that heredity plays a role. If both your parents have allergies, there's a 50% chance you will, too. And you have a 25% chance if only one of your parents is allergic. Experts also think that prolonged exposure to high levels of allergens can eventually provoke allergies in anyone. That's why people sometimes develop allergies later in life. Studies also show that healthy children living in homes with high levels of dust mites are 500% more likely to develop asthma. By clearing the air of contaminating allergens, Easy Air Organic Allergy Relief Spray helps you prevent problems before they start, and also lowers your child's risk of developing asthma. </p>

<p><strong>How often should the Spray be used?</strong><br />
Asthma and allergy symptoms vary tremendously. Some people suffer only slightly; others live with extreme symptoms. You'll know it's time to "re-apply" when symptoms start to recur. Every 16-oz bottle of Easy Air Organic Allergy Relief Spray treats up to 250 square feet of indoor space and stays effective for up to 4 weeks. You can ensure longer-lasting protection and earn volume discount with the 32-oz REFILL bottle.</p>
