<br />
<p><strong>What is Cr&egrave;me de la Femme?</strong><br />                       Cr&egrave;me de la Femme is an all-natural vaginal lubricant.  Developed by a woman doctor and trusted by women for over 30 years, it is a luxurious yet ultra-sheer vaginal cream that leaves protective, silky moisture on intimate tissue - giving instant relief from uncomfortable vaginal dryness, no matter why it happens.</p>
<p><strong>What are the causes of vaginal dryness?</strong><br />                 Anytime a woman's estrogen hormone level gets too low, the result is vaginal dryness. If delicate intimate tissue stays dry too long, it can become painful. Over time, vaginal irritation and infection can occur. Estrogen can diminish for many reasons. Menopause is the most common cause. So by age 50, more than 80% of women are beginning to live with uncomfortable dryness. But low estrogen can happen earlier so the other common reasons for vaginal dryness include breastfeeding, extreme exhaustion or prolonged stress, chemotherapy, ovarian dysfunction, birth control pills and even eating disorders.</p>
<p><strong>How does Cr&egrave;me de la Femme work?</strong><br />                 It works a lot like a rich, luxurious facial moisturizer.  It protects tissue with an ultra-thin layer of "fluid-film" lubrication and slows down the vaginal atrophy (tissue shrinkage) that is a normal part of aging.  Of course, only prescription hormone can replenish estrogen. In recent years, however, concern over the medical risks associated with traditional hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has led to new, innovative approaches. Cr&egrave;me de la Femme is one of them - because it relieves dryness without relying on hormone additives, harsh ingredients or parabens.</p>
<p><strong>How often should Cr&egrave;me de la Femme be used?</strong><br />     Because Cr&egrave;me de la Femme is made exclusively from natural ingredients, it can be applied as often as desired. For all-day comfort, some women apply it externally after their bath or shower.  Others prefer to use the thin applicator that comes sealed in every box, to apply the lubricant internally.  You will probably want to apply daily, at least initially, to replenish moisture and stop vaginal irritation.  Eventually, you may find that you can use less lubricant, less often.  In addition, most women re-apply before intercourse.  Cr&egrave;me de la Femme is self-cleansing, so it leaves no messy residue and never requires follow-up douching.</p>
<p><strong>What are the ingredients in Cr&egrave;me de la Femme?</strong><br />   Cr&egrave;me de la Femme is a blend of extremely pure, pharmaceutical-grade mineral oil, petrolatum, paraffin and ceresin. So Cr&egrave;me de la Femme is an oil-based vaginal lubricant that remains semi-solid at room temperature. Then the instant it touches warm skin, it melts into silky moisture. Unlike other vaginal lubricants, Cr&egrave;me de la Femme contains no alcohol, dyes or glycerin. All ingredients used in the formula are FDA monographed and registered.</p>
<p><strong>Who formulated Cr&egrave;me de la Femme?</strong><br />               Marilyn Pratt, MD, spent over five years developing and testing Cr&egrave;me de la Femme. She started the project because so many of her own patients complained about menopausal vaginal dryness and the need for a safe, elegant remedy. Since 1986, when Dr. Pratt introduced the product to the general public, countless women nationwide have come to depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>Can Cr&egrave;me de la Femme cause vaginal infection?</strong><br />   No. In fact, Cr&egrave;me de la Femme actually helps protect against yeast infection.  Here's why: most vaginal lubricants are water-based products and water is a breeding ground for yeast.  Because Cr&egrave;me de la Femme is an oil-based lubricant, it moisturizes without contributing to yeast growth.  In addition, because it's oil-based, it doesn't run or dry up fast. Protection lasts for hours, lowering your risk of abrasion, bladder infection & vaginal irritation.  Finally, because Cr&egrave;me de la Femme contains no glycerin (a form of sugar), it is safe even for women with diabetes and other blood sugar variances. Put simply, Cr&egrave;me de la Femme never exposes women to the dangers associated with of some lubricants.</p>
<p><strong>Will Cr&egrave;me de la Femme interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br />
Because it is not a drug, Cr&egrave;me de la Femme does not interfere with the efficacy of any prescription drug.  It can be used by women undergoing chemotherapy. It is safe to use while taking birth control pills.  Many women on traditional hormone replacement therapy, and even bio-identical hormones, still combat a degree of vaginal dryness. They too can use Cr&egrave;me de la Femme for some extra, soothing relief.</p>
<p><strong>Can Cr&egrave;me de la Femme be used with condoms?</strong><br />     Cr&egrave;me de la Femme can be safely used with polyurethane or natural lamb's skin condoms. It is not recommended for use with latex condoms because the oils in the lubricant can deteriorate the latex.</p>
<p><strong>Is oral sex dangerous when using Cr&egrave;me de la Femme?</strong><br />Absolutely not! Cr&egrave;me De La Femme has no flavor, so your partner won't taste anything. Because it's an oil-based lubricant, he might feel a slightly oily residue sensation. But there is nothing in the product that is dangerous, even if swallowed in small amounts.</p>
