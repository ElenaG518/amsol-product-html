<p><strong>What is Pain Spray Roll-On?</strong><br />
Pain Spray Roll-On is an herbal pain relief formula that stops pain in less than 2 minutes. Just like Original Pain Spray, this all natural liquid-gel is popular with people of every age, living with all sorts of aches and pains. Slide the rollerball applicator gently over any outside part of the body that hurts. Within seconds the relief begins. Safe and non-habit forming.</p>
<p><strong>Who should use Pain Spray Roll-On?</strong><br />
Pain Spray Roll-On is great for anyone in pain, whether it's from a minor sports injury or from a chronic pain problem. Plus the easy-glide applicator makes it perfect if you're targeting pain in hard-to-reach places. Active adults love it following a tough workout, heavy housework or a morning of gardening. Sports enthusiasts rely on it to soothe sore muscles, pulled ligaments, strained back, tired hands or puffy feet. Pain Spray Roll-On is also wonderful for kids because it never drips or spills; and it dries in less than a minute.</p>
<p><strong>How often can Pain Spray Roll-On be applied?</strong><br />
Because it's an all-natural pain reliever, you can use Pain Spray Roll-On as often as you like. Some people find that a single application in the morning offers all-day relief. Others like to re-apply periodically throughout the day. The more you apply, the stronger the effect. No mess, like old-fashioned creams, gels and ointments. And Pain Spray Roll-On smells as refreshing as a field of wild peppermint.</p> 
<p><strong>What are the ingredients in Pain Spray Roll-On?</strong><br />
Every ingredient in this herbal pain relief blend is approved by the FDA. The most powerful ingredient is extra-pure imported menthol. Natural wintergreen, eucalyptus and peppermint oils are added to enhance the therapeutic benefits and lend the refreshing aroma. A variety of herbal moisturizers are blended in, to help protect skin from dryness. Finally, a light botanical thickener is added to make it slide on effortlessly, stay exactly where you put it, and dry quickly. All-herbal Pain Spray Roll-On is never greasy. It won't stain skin or fabrics.</p> 
<p><strong>How does Pain Spray Roll-On work?</strong><br />
When nerves, muscles or joints are irritated, they send powerful pain signals to the brain. The body's natural reaction is to tense up. Unfortunately, that tension only increases the perception of pain.  And the body tightens even more. It's a vicious cycle. Pain Spray Roll-On can stop pain fast because it takes advantage of an important medical fact: the brain can process only one new sensory message at a time. By replacing pain signals with equally intense alternatives (initially a rejuvenating cool sensation followed by deep, soothing warmth) this herbal liquid-gel interrupts the pain-tension-pain cycle.</p>
<p><strong>How long does the pain relief last?</strong><br />
Count on hours of relief. And the more you apply, the longer it will last. Typically, Pain Spray Roll-On soothes discomfort for 1 to 5 hours, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the amount of formula that's applied. You also can enjoy added benefit by taking a hot bath or shower before you use it. The warm water will gently open your pores, allowing the powerful herbal formula to sink deeper down, easing even more of the pain.</p>
<p><strong>Can Pain Spray Roll-On become addictive?</strong><br />
No, Pain Spray Roll-On is 100% non-habit forming and never causes drowsiness. In fact, the formula is associated with absolutely no harmful side effects.</p> 
<p><strong>Does Pain Spray Roll-On interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br />
No, Pain Spray Roll-On does not interfere with the efficacy of any prescription medication. In fact, it can be a wonderful "companion" to many traditional pain relief treatments and drugs.</p> 
<p><strong>Would Pain Spray Mist be better for me than the Roll-On?</strong><br />
Premiere's Pain Spray contains all the same ingredients as our Roll-On. However the spray mist is a 100% clear liquid formula - so every squirt covers a large skin surface without ever touching the places that hurt. This makes Original Pain Spray especially good for people with chronic pain conditions like arthritis, carpal tunnel, tendonitis, pinched nerves, sciatic, restless leg syndrome or fibromyalgia. Great for relieving all-over muscle pain, back pain, swollen joints, foot and ankle pain, neck pain or shoulder pain. Helps relieve leg cramps, bruising and morning stiffness. And because it's all natural, pregnant women can rely on to soothe their sore back, hips, legs and feet.</p>        </div>
