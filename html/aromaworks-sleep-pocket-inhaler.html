        <div id="asTab-2" class="asTab">
            Include SLEEP Pocket Inhaler in your essential oil medicine cabinet. The internal cotton spine comes soaked in pure essential oils. When you place the inhaler under your nostrils and breathe deeply, the oils' microscopic molecules make contact with tiny olfactory nerve receptors inside your nostrils. Those receptors instantly relay the molecules to your limbic system, the brain's command center for emotions and metabolic function. This is the principle behind the ancient healing art of aromatherapy. Individual results may vary.

<p><strong>What is the SLEEP Pocket Inhaler?</strong><br />SLEEP is an all-natural remedy for insomnia. It helps you fall asleep, stay asleep and wake up refreshed. Inside this plastic inhaler is a cotton spine soaked in rich essential oils that promote drowsiness and contribute to deep sleep. It is the perfect solution to occasional insomnia caused by jetlag, excitement, illness, discomfort or mental preoccupations. SLEEP also helps combat chronic insomnia if used as part of larger treatment regimen. In most cases, SLEEP begins working in about 10 minutes. It is 100% safe, non-habit forming, and puts the power of clinically-tested aromatherapy at your fingertips.</p>

<p><strong>How do you use SLEEP Pocket Inhaler?</strong><br />It's easy. You unscrew the cap, place the inhaler below one nostril and inhale once or twice.  Since your olfactory nerve receptors cannot cross from one side of the brain to the other, inhaling through your right nostril affects only your right brain. Experts know that each side of the brain affects different aspects of health and well-being. So you can maximize benefit by inhaling first through one nostril and then the other.</p>

<p><strong>What exactly is aromatherapy?</strong><br />Essential oil aromatherapy is an ancient healing art that uses botanical sap (extracted from blossoms, leaves, bark and roots) to restore balance to the body, mind and emotions. It is based on the premise that your body's natural state is balance. Illness or upset occur when that balance is disrupted by poor lifestyle habits or a contaminant. Among its many benefits, aromatherapy has been scientifically shown to perk brain power, promote appetite control, deliver anxiety relief and help you sleep better.</p>

<p><strong>How does "inhalation" aromatherapy work?</strong><br />
As the name suggests, you inhale the aroma of a particular essential oil (or, more often, a blend of oils) selected because they have a curative effect on the problems you're experiencing. French chemist Rene-Maurice Gattefosse coined the phrase in the 1930's.  The idea is simple: because essential oils are "volatile" (meaning they generate vapors that float through the air), their molecules can enter your lungs when they're inhaled, eventually making their way into your bloodstream. During inhalation, they also strike tiny, hair-like olfactory nerve receptors inside your nose. These receptors take them directly to your limbic system, the part of your brain that regulates unconscious metabolism, controls your stress responses and governs mental activity.</p>

<p><strong>Do scientists consider aromatherapy effective?</strong><br />Yes, many do. By the early 1900's, essential oil aromatherapy had started to enjoy popularity and respect among scientists and physicians. For example, in the 1920's, Italian scientists documented its bacteria-destroying capability as well as its ability to impact the nervous system. During the 1940's, French physician Dr. Jean Valnet used essential oil aromatherapy (in ointment form) to disinfect and heal war injuries. Over the past 20 years, clinical research has started to show the effectiveness of this healing approach. Reputable studies have looked at problems ranging from food cravings to insomnia, anxiety, depression and even addiction; and data shows that essential oil aromatherapy can be an effective aide to treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Is SLEEP safe for everyone?</strong><br />SLEEP contains essential oil of bergamot which should not be used in large amount during pregnancy. If you are expecting a baby and want to use the product, be sure to check first with you doctor or midwife. Also, people with asthma and other respiratory ailments should start by using smaller amounts of any essential oil. Then gradually increase if no adverse reaction occurs. Finally, Children under 5 should not use any aromatherapy blend.</p>

<p><strong>Can SLEEP interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br />
No, essential oils do not interfere with prescription medication. Used by themselves, they can solve an occasional for even the healthiest people. For those with more significant health issues, essential oil aromatherapy can actually enhance the benefits of traditional medical care and prescription drugs.</p>
