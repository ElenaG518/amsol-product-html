            Easy Air Organic Laundry Rinse destroys the microscopic protein particles (called indoor allergens) produced by dust mites and household pets. It is these allergens that provoke pet, dust, and dust mite allergy symptoms. Used regularly, it helps relieve and protect against allergy headaches, sneezing, coughing, runny nose, burning eyes, scratchy throat and itchy skin. Strong enough to decontaminate pet toys. Safe enough to use on baby blankets. Keeps all machine washables (and fine lingerie) allergy-free for weeks.

<p><strong>What is Easy Air Organic Allergy Relief Laundry Rinse?</strong><br />
This unscented, organic laundry rinse is a laboratory-tested treatment for indoor allergies and asthma symptoms. Made with 100% natural ingredients, it deconstructs the molecular structure of ALL indoor contaminants and helps keep all your washable fabrics "allergy-free" through 4 washings. </p>

<p><strong>How does Easy Air Laundry Rinse work? </strong><br />
Add 2 oz. (&frac14 cup) of this biodegradable Laundry Rinse to the final rinse cycle of clothing, towels, bed linen, throw rugs, baby blankets and fine washables - and destroy BILLIONS of allergy-causing contaminants. These invisibly small "protein allergens" float through the air and constantly make their way indoors. Then, because they're sticky, they cling to fiber surfaces. No amount of ordinary washing or bleaching can eliminate them. That's one reason for the EPA warning, that our homes are the most "allergic places" in the nation! Luckily, Easy Air Laundry Rinse can help protect your washables for weeks. (NOTE: Also use the Laundry Rinse when washing your pet's cloth toys, cushions, towels or other fabric items the animal uses for play or bath.)</p>

<p><strong>What are "indoor allergens"?</strong><br />
They're invisibly small protein particles shed by all living creatures Dust and dust mites are major culprits. So are "pet residuals" (like fur, dander, saliva, urine and feathers) that often activate cat allergy symptoms and provoke dog allergies. Even our own bodies produce these allergens, in the form of perspiration and dead skin cells which we shed continuously, day and night. That's why a laundry care product is so crucial in winning the war against indoor allergies and asthma. </p>

<p><strong>What are the symptoms of indoor allergies?</strong><br />
The most common indoor allergy symptoms are like bad cold symptoms: puffy or red eyes, tearing and burning, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and upper respiratory congestion. Bad headaches and sinus pressure can also be symptoms.  In more extreme cases, symptoms can also include itchy skin and rashes, shortness of breath, extreme exhaustion and even serious joint pain. </p>

<p><strong>What causes asthma & indoor allergies? </strong><br />
Frankly, there are many causes of indoor allergies. Scientists think that heredity plays a role. If both your parents have allergies, there's a 50% chance you will, too. And you have a 25% chance if only one of your parents is allergic. Experts also think that prolonged exposure to high levels of allergens can eventually provoke allergies in anyone. That's why people sometimes develop allergies later in life. Studies also show that healthy children living around high levels of dust mites and other indoor contaminants are 500% more likely to develop asthma. By removing these sticky allergens from clothing, bed sheets, towels and other washable fabrics, Easy Air Organic Laundry Rinse helps prevent problems before they start, and even lowers a child's risk of developing asthma.</p>

<p><strong>How common are indoor allergies?</strong><br />
Scientists report that over 60 million Americans have indoor allergies. The American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology reports that 10% of us need dust mite allergy relief. Pet allergies are also widespread. Dog allergies strike 1 in 7 of us. Another 1 in every 3 of us has a cat allergy. Researchers also say that you're at greater risk for indoor allergies if you already have an outdoor allergy (like hay fever). </p>

<p><strong>How often should the Laundry Rinse be used?</strong><br />
Asthma and indoor allergy symptoms vary tremendously. Some people suffer only slightly; others live with extreme symptoms. You'll know it's time to use more Laundry Rinse when allergy or asthma symptoms start to recur. Every 16-oz bottle treats 8 full laundry loads and protects fabrics through as many as 4 wash cycles. You can ensure longer-lasting protection and earn volume discount with the 32-oz REFILL bottle.</p>
