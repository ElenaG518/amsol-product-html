            With Premiere's Pain Spray Mix & Match 3-Pack you can choose exactly how to get temporary relief from minor aches and pains. There's liquid Spray Mist for all-over soreness, stiffness and everyday muscle ache. There's Roll-On liquid gel to target specific, often hard-to-reach places that hurt. Choose the combination of Premiere's Pain Spray products that's right for you.<br /><br />Pain Spray Mix & Match 3-Pack is designed for anyone who needs extra-powerful muscle and joint pain relief. Instead of fighting the pain one way, you deliver a double-punch and the result is more comfort, FAST. Start with an application of Pain Spray Mist. Pump the slender spray mist bottle to cover large areas of surface skin without ever touching the places that hurt. Then follow with an application of Pain Spray Roll-On, targeting hard-to-reach places along with the most painful spots. Pain Spray Mix & Match 3-Pack is perfect for people with chronic pain conditions. So it's a perfect all natural arthritis remedy. It's also ideal for active adults and weekend sports enthusiasts who rely on it to soothe occasional sore muscles, pulled ligaments and high or low backache. Use it to relieve almost any pain - from tired, puffy feet to carpal tunnel, tendonitis, pinched nerves, sciatica, neuropathy, restless leg syndrome or fibromyalgia.<br /><br />Because Pain Spray Mist and Roll-On are all-natural pain remedies, you can use either of them - or both - as often as you like. Depending on your individual pain tolerance, you may find that a single application in the morning offers all-day relief. Or you might want to re-apply periodically throughout the day. The more you use, the stronger the effect. There's no mess, like old-fashioned creams, gels and ointments. And both formulas smell as refreshing as a field of wild peppermint.<br /><br />Original Pain Spray and Pain Spray Roll-On contain only FDA-approved ingredients. The most powerful is extra-pure imported menthol. Natural wintergreen, eucalyptus and peppermint oils are added to enhance the therapeutic benefits and lend a refreshing aroma. Then a variety of herbal moisturizers are mixed in, to help protect skin from dryness. Finally, a light botanical thickener is added to Pain Spray Roll-On, making it a sheer liquid-gel that slides on effortlessly, stays exactly where you put it, and dries quickly. Original Pain Spray and Pain Spray Roll-On are both greaseless. They won't stain skin or fabrics. Both formulas are 100% non-habit forming and never cause drowsiness. In fact, they're associated with absolutely no harmful side effects.

<p><strong>Who should use Pain Spray Mix & Match?</strong><br />                                                                                               Pain Spray Mix & Match is designed for anyone who needs extra-powerful muscle and joint pain relief. Instead of fighting the pain one way, you deliver a double-punch and the result is more comfort, FAST. Start with an application of Original Pain Spray. Pump the slender spray mist bottle to cover large areas of surface skin without ever touching the places that hurt. Then follow with an application of Pain Spray Roll-On, targeting hard-to-reach places along with the most painful spots. Mix & Match is perfect for people with chronic pain conditions like arthritis, carpal tunnel, tendonitis, pinched nerves, sciatic, restless leg syndrome or fibromyalgia. Equally good for active adults and weekend sports enthusiasts who rely on it to soothe occasional sore muscles, pulled ligaments, backache, tired hands or puffy feet.</p>
<p><strong>How often can Pain Spray Mix & Match be used?</strong><br />                                                                                 Because Original Pain Spray Mist and Roll-On are all natural pain remedies, you can use either of them - or both - as often as you like. Some people find that a single application in the morning offers all-day relief. Others like to re-apply periodically throughout the day. The more you use, the stronger the effect. There's no mess, like old-fashioned creams, gels and ointments. And both formulas smell as refreshing as a field of wild peppermint.</p>
<p><strong>What ingredients are in Pain Spray Mix & Match?</strong><br />         Original Pain Spray and Pain Spray Roll-On contain only FDA-approved ingredients. The most powerful is extra-pure imported menthol. Natural wintergreen, eucalyptus and peppermint oils are added to enhance the therapeutic benefits and lend a refreshing aroma. Then a variety of herbal moisturizers are mixed in, to help protect skin from dryness. Finally, a light botanical thickener is added to Pain Spray Roll-On, making it a sheer liquid-gel that slides on effortlessly, stays exactly where you put it, and dries quickly. Original Pain Spray and Pain Spray Roll-On are both greaseless. They won't stain skin or fabrics.</p>
<p><strong>How exactly does Pain Spray Mix & Match work?</strong><br />           When nerves, muscles or joints are irritated, they send powerful pain signals to the brain. The body's natural reaction is to tense up. Unfortunately, that tension only increases the perception of pain.  And the body tightens even more. It's a vicious cycle. Original Pain Spray Mist and Pain Spray Roll-On can stop pain fast because they take advantage of an important medical fact: the brain can process only one new sensory message at a time. By replacing pain signals with equally intense alternatives (initially a rejuvenating cool sensation followed by deep, soothing warmth) these herbal pain formulas interrupt the pain-tension-pain cycle.</p>
<p><strong>How long does the pain relief last?</strong><br />                     Count on hours of relief. And the more you apply, the longer it will last. Typically, the formulas soothe discomfort for 1 to 5 hours, depending on the severity of the symptoms and the amount you use. Enjoy added benefit by taking a hot bath or shower before applying.  The warm water will gently open your pores, allowing the powerful herbal formula to sink deeper down, easing even more of the pain.</p>
<p><strong>Can Pain Spray Mix & Match become addictive?</strong><br />           No, both formulas are 100% non-habit forming and never cause drowsiness. In fact, they're associated with absolutely no harmful side effects. 
<p><strong>Does Pain Spray Mix & Match interfere with prescription drugs?</strong><br /> 
No, neither formula interferes with the efficacy of any prescription medication. In fact, a Mix & Match Pack can be a wonderful "companion" to many traditional pain relief treatments and drugs.</p>
