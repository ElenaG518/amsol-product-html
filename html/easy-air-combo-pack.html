            This unscented, organic allergy spray and laundry rinse are laboratory-tested treatments for indoor allergies and asthma symptoms. Made with 100% natural ingredients, they deconstruct the molecular structure of ALL indoor contaminants.<br
            />
            <br /> Use Allergy Relief Spray to treat mattress & pillows, upholstery, carpet and drapes – the places most contaminated by household allergens and most likely to be causes of indoor allergy symptoms. Benefits last up to 4 weeks. Use Allergy
            Relief Laundry Rinse to destroy the billions of protein allergens that cling to family clothes, towels and bedding. Great for hand-washables, too. Benefits last through 4 laundry cycles.<br />
            <br /> Use both products to destroy BILLIONS of allergy-causing contaminants. These invisibly small protein allergens float through the air and constantly make their way indoors. Then, because they’re sticky, they cling to fiber surfaces.
            That’s one reason for the EPA warning, that our homes are the most allergic places in the nation! Protect your home with this money-saving combo.

                <strong>What is the Easy Air Organic Anti-Allergy Combo Pack?</strong><br /> This unique 2-formula Combo Pack is a laboratory-tested treatment for "indoor allergies" and asthma symptoms. Some people who suffer from these conditions are
                reacting to indoor dust. Others have dog allergies, dust mite allergy or cat allergy. Many suffer for years without pinpointing the real reason for their symptoms! That’s because environmental “allergens” are invisible and airborne, constantly
                floating indoors through doors, windows, ventilation systems and piping. No amount of cleaning or disinfecting can get rid of them. Little wonder the EPA has issued a warning – that American homes are the most allergy-provoking places
                in the country! Used regularly, the dual action power of the Easy Air Combo Pack can offer relief, turning your home or office into an Allergy-Free Zone for up to 4 weeks.
            </p>
            <p id="whoshould">
                <strong>How does the Easy Air Combo Pack work? </strong><br /> The Combo Pack instantly stops symptoms by deconstructing the molecular structure of ALL “protein allergens” that cause them. It’s like taking a deadly boulder and crumbling
                it into harmless rubble. Made with 100% organic ingredients, the Combo Pack is an all-natural alternative to caustic pesticides and other harsh allergy relief products.

            <p id="howoften">
                <strong>What exactly are "indoor allergens"?</strong><br /> They’re the invisibly small protein particles shed by all living creatures. Dust and dust mites are major culprits. So are "pet residuals" (fur, dander, saliva, urine, feces and
                feathers) that provoke dog allergies and cat allergy symptoms. Even our own bodies produce these allergens, in the form of perspiration and dead skin cells which we shed continuously, day and night. All these contaminants can provoke allergy
                and asthma symptoms. </p>
            <p id="ingredients">
                <strong>What are the symptoms of indoor allergies?</strong><br /> The most common indoor allergy symptoms are like bad cold symptoms: puffy or red eyes, tearing and burning, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and upper respiratory congestion.
                Bad headaches and sinus pressure can also be symptoms. In more extreme cases, however, symptoms can also include itchy skin and rashes, shortness of breath, extreme exhaustion and even serious joint pain.
            </p>
            <p id="howitworks">
                <strong>What causes asthma & indoor allergies? </strong><br /> Frankly, there are many causes of indoor allergies. Scientists think that heredity plays a role. If both your parents have allergies, there’s a 50% chance you will, too. And
                you have a 25% chance if only one of your parents is allergic. Experts also think that prolonged exposure to high levels of allergens can eventually provoke allergies in anyone. That’s why people sometimes develop allergies later in life.
                Studies also show that healthy children living in homes with high levels of dust mites are 500% more likely to develop asthma. By clearing the air of contaminating allergens, the Easy Air Combo Pack helps you prevent this problem before
                it starts and lowers your child’s risk of developing asthma.
            </p>
            <p id="howlong">
                <strong>How often should the Easy Air Combo Pack be used?</strong><br /> Asthma and indoor allergy symptoms vary tremendously. Some people suffer only slightly; others live with extreme symptoms. You’ll know it’s time to "re-apply" to
                rooms and washables when symptoms start to recur. Every 16-oz bottle of Easy Air Organic Allergy Relief Spray treats up to 250 square feet of indoor space and stays effective for up to 4 weeks. Each 16-oz bottle of Easy Air Organic Laundry
                Rinse offers 8 full laundry loads of protection; and fabrics stay allergen-free through at least 2 washings.
