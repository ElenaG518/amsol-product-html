        </div>
        <div id="asTab-2" class="asTab">
            <strong>Cleanser:</strong> With its mega-dose of vitamin C, this age-defying facial cleanser promotes healthier, brighter, younger-looking skin. By lifting away oil and dirt, it diminishes the appearance of blackheads and patchy breakout on the chin, along the hairline, and across the nose. Packed with powerful herbal ingredients, it helps reduce the red and inflamed look of acne-prone teenage skin and adult rosacea. Infused with calming lavender and rosehip fruit extract, it soothes and moisturizes the skin after shaving to prevent rash and razor burn.<br /><br /><strong>Serum:</strong> This revolutionary stabilized vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) formula helps prevent signs of facial aging and keeps young skin looking firm and supple for as long as possible. Decreases the look of sagging skin, fine lines, coarse wrinkling, dark under-eye circles, and age spots (hyperpigmentation). Also a soothing moisturizer for acne-prone skin and rosacea. Calms the redness of a ruddy complexion. Even combats the damaging effects of sun exposure and outdoor free radicals.

            This is a science-based skincare regimen scaled down to just 2 formulas. (1) A pure and highly effective liquid "soap" that cleans the skin while also nourishing it with ingredients that promote collagen production, elasticity and radiance. (2) A highly-concentrated serum that contains vitamins, antioxidants and nutrients to improve the look and feel of all skin types. Instead of the traditional 4-step regimen of cleanser-toner-serum-moisturizer, these two products offer both women and men a complete, affordable, all-natural skincare system.<br /><br />Because it utilizes the newest and most revolutionary breakthrough in skincare science - "stabilized vitamin C" (as ascorbic acid). Dermatologists and aestheticians have known for years that vitamin C could diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production, improve skin texture, and enhance elasticity. The problem has been an inability to keep vitamin C fresh and active for more than a few weeks. La Vie en C has overcome this barrier, offering an exclusive line of long-lasting formulas that hydrate the skin and diminish visible signs of aging.<br /><br />Absolutely anyone can improve their complexion with this skincare system. That's true for men as well as women, regardless of age. Both formulas help keep young skin looking great longer. Also perfect for mature skin because the formulas can smooth uneven skin tone, brighten under-eye darkness, lighten age spots, and minimize the look of saggy skin. For women, the products work like a daily mini-lift. Men appreciate this fast, no-fuss approach to male skincare. Fragrance-free, the cleanser and serum soothe their face before and after shaving to prevent razor burn and rash. Blended entirely without greasy ingredients, the products never create a shiny complexion. They never leave a sticky residue to clog pores. This makes them ideal for acne-prone skin. Safe even for people with eczema, psoriasis and other skin-sensitivity issues.<br /><br />For best results, use the Facial Cleanser twice a day. In the morning, to clean away the oil, dirt, and bacteria that inevitably accumulate overnight. At night, to wash away make-up, daily grime and pollutants. Take care to avoid the eye area. Don't over-scrub, and always rinse well. Then pat skin dry with a soft, clean towel. The Moisturizer Serum is highly concentrated and ultra-active, so it takes very little product to achieve desired results. One application daily, before bed, may be enough for young, non-problematic skin. For more mature or highly sensitive skin, it is best to apply twice a day, morning and evening.

For best results, use the Facial Cleanser twice a day. In the morning, to clean away the oil, dirt, and bacteria that inevitably accumulate overnight. At night, to wash away make-up, daily grime and pollutants. Take care to avoid the eye area. Don't over-scrub, and always rinse well. Then pat skin dry with a soft, clean towel.

One application daily, before bed, may be enough for young, non-problematic skin. For more mature or highly sensitive skin, it is best to apply twice a day, morning and evening.</p>

<p><strong>Can the formulas be used separately?</strong><br />
Yes. However, they were developed as a 2-formula skincare system. So, for maximum benefit, they should be used together.</p>

<p><strong>What ingredients are in the two formulas?</strong><br />   Both formulas are 100% free of dangerous ingredients found in many of today's skincare products. No phthalates, parabens, dyes, or added fragrances.<br /><br />
The <strong>Moisturizing Facial Soap</strong> contains distilled water, vegetable glycerin, potassium hydroxide (used for saponification only), saponified organic coconut oil, saponified organic olive oil, Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), Rosa canina (rosehip) seed oil &  fruit extract, Matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract, d-alpha Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, and Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) essential oil.<br /><br />
The <strong>Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum</strong> contains distilled Water, olive leaf extract, matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract, Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), organic vegetable glycerin, Rosa mosqueta (rosehip) fruit extract, Calophyllum inophyllum (tamanu) seed oil,  Siegesbeckia orientali (xi xian cao) extract,  jojoba oil, Heterotheca inuloides (Mexican arnica) extract, sesodium acrylate, sodium carbomer, sodium carbomer polysorbate 80, acryloyldimethyl taurate copoylmer, sodium hyauronate (vegan), benzylacohol, and dehydroacetic acid.</p>

<p><strong>Should I use a moisturizer after these products?</strong><br />Dry skin does need ample moisture. So it would be wise to add extra protective hydration with a daily moisturizer. Be careful to choose a chemical-free product. Wash face with La Vie en C Moisturizing Facial Soap. Immediately apply the Moisturizer Serum. Then wait 15 minutes before adding your moisturizer.</p>
