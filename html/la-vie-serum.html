<p><strong>What is La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum?</strong><br />La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum is a highly-concentrated blend of vitamins, antioxidants and nutrients that improve skin appearance with just a single application. By creating an ultra-sheer barrier against damaging environmental contaminants, it helps protect facial tissue. And by incorporating gentle moisturizing botanicals, it helps keep skin looking healthy, bright and youthful. Every bottle of this sheer liquid-gel is manufactured exclusively in small batches, under the strictest quality-control standards, and contains a handmade blend of all-natural ingredients.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Serum actually different from a moisturizer?</strong><br />Yes! Far more concentrated than a moisturizing cream or lotion, La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum blends ultra-active skin nutrients that can bring faster and more effective results than a finishing moisturizer. Plus, it is formulated entirely without greasy or oily ingredients. So it never leaves that sticky feeling or glossy shine associated with traditional moisturizers. Applied after cleansing, this all-natural serum can serve as the final step in a responsible daily skincare regimen.</p>

<p><strong>How does the product actually work?</strong><br />
At the center of the formula's remarkable activity is a new breakthrough in skincare science: "stabilized vitamin C" (as ascorbic acid). Dermatologists and aestheticians have known for years that vitamin C could diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production, and improve the skin's texture and elasticity. The problem has been an inability to keep vitamin C fresh and active for more than a few weeks. La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum has overcome that barrier, offering long-lasting facial hydration and protection. Additional benefits come from the infusion of powerful antioxidants and nutrients like rosehip fruit extract, xi xian cao, Mexican arnica and chamomile extract. It also contains both tamanu and jojoba oils, which keep skin well-hydrated and radiant.</p>

<p><strong>Who can benefit from using the Serum?</strong><br />       Women and men of all ages can improve their complexion with daily use of the serum. This science-based formula helps boost collagen production and feeds the skin without leaving a residue that can clog pores. Keeps young skin looking great for as long as possible. Also perfect for mature skin. Decreases the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Smooths facial skin tone. Lightens under-eye darkness and age spots. Women find that it offers the look of a daily mini-lift, diminishing saggy skin and promoting elasticity. Men appreciate that it is a fast, no-fuss approach to male skincare. Fragrance-free, it soothes and hydrates their skin after shaving to prevent rash and razor burn. Also helps with acne-prone skin. Even ideal for people with eczema, psoriasis and other skin sensitivity issues.</p>

<p><strong>How often should I apply it?</strong><br />                 This liquid gel is highly concentrated, so it takes very little product to achieve the desired result. One application daily, before bed, may be enough for someone with young, non-problematic skin. For more mature or highly sensitive skin, or for a troubled complexion, it is best to apply twice a day, morning and night. Always begin by cleansing the face. Then gently rub 2-3 pumps of La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum between the hands and lightly patted onto face and neck.</p>

<p><strong>What ingredients are in the Serum?</strong><br />         La Vie en C Antioxidant Moisturizer Serum contains distilled Water, olive leaf extract, matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract, Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), organic vegetable glycerin, Rosa mosqueta (rosehip) fruit extract, Calophyllum inophyllum (tamanu) seed oil,  Siegesbeckia orientali (xi xian cao) extract,  jojoba oil, Heterotheca inuloides (Mexican arnica) extract, sesodium acrylate, sodium carbomer, sodium carbomer polysorbate 80, acryloyldimethyl taurate copoylmer, sodium hyauronate (vegan), benzylacohol, and dehydroacetic acid. Contains none of the dangerous ingredients found in many of today's skincare products. No phthalates, parabens, dyes or added fragrances.</p>

<p><strong>Should I apply a moisturizer after the Serum?</strong><br />Dry skin does need ample moisture. So it would be wise to add extra protective hydration with a daily moisturizer. Be careful to choose a chemical-free product. Wash face with La Vie en C Moisturizing Facial Soap. Immediately apply the Moisturizer Serum. Then allow 15 minutes for the serum to be fully absorbed before adding your moisturizer.</p>
