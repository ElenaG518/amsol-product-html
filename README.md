## Instructions
All files in html directory should have the same structure as **template.html**. 

**html/pain-spray-mist.html** is complete. The template has been applied to this file and all sections have been filled in. 
The template should be applied to all other files.

There are six sections in the template. Copy in the text for each section as described below. Maintain any paragraph formatting using breaks.

1. *Description* is the first main section. Copy the text from the Word documents are located in **copy/description**. 
2. *Uses* is the subsection under Description. There is a spreadsheet in **copy/wordpress-links** with links to the WordPress product page. Copy the text from the PRODUCT USES section on this page.
3. *Ingredients* is the second main section. Copy the text from the 100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS section on the WordPress product page.
4. *Tell Me More* is the third main section. Copy the text from the PRODUCT DETAIL section on the WordPress product page. 
5. *FAQ* is the fourth main section. Copy the text from the Word documents located in **copy/faq**. If there isn't a specific FAQ document for a product variation, use the FAQ from the main product. For example, use the same Pain Spray FAQ for the Pain Spray 3-pack, Pain Spray 6-pack, Pain Spray 12-pack and Pain Spray 24-pack.
6. *Reviews* is the fifth main section. Copy the text from the PRODUCT REVIEWS section at the bottom of the WordPress product page. To save time, instead of copying and pasting each quote one at a time, copy the entire block of quotes into [TextFixer](https://www.textfixer.com/html/convert-text-html.php). Then select 'Use line break tags only' and unselect 'Encode characters with accents and similar'. Then click 'Convert Text to HTML' to get the formatted output for the whole list. The list of reviews is the same for each product family.
